# Dense-Jump Flow Matching Policy

This repository provides a minimal, reference implementation of the Dense-Jump Flow Matching Policy. The method introduced is designed to be **simple and effective**, making it easy to implement and extend—perfect for "vibe coding" tools or integrating on top of your own flow matching policy codebase.

The main purpose of this repository is to share additional experiments and ablation studies that were not included in the original paper due to length restrictions.

## Datasets

This project primarily uses datasets from **Gymnasium** and **Minari**.

*   **Gymnasium**: [https://gymnasium.farama.org/](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) - A standard API for reinforcement learning environments.
*   **Minari**: [https://minari.farama.org/](https://minari.farama.org/) - A library for hosting and managing offline reinforcement learning datasets.


## Repository Structure & Usage

### 1. Training (`train_flow.py`)
This is the main entry point for training the flow matching policy. It handles data loading (supporting Minari, D4RL, and local datasets), normalization, and the training loop.

**Usage Example:**
```bash
python train_flow.py --task pendulum_expert --epochs 100 --batch_size 256
```

### 2. Inference (`inference.py`)
Used to evaluate a trained policy in its environment. It calculates success rates and returns, and can export results to a CSV file. It automatically loads task configurations from `tasks_paths.json`.

**Usage Example:**
```bash
python inference.py --task pendulum_expert --policy_path logs/flow_matching/best_model.pth --num_episodes 10
```

### 5. Analysis Tools (`knn/`)
This directory contains scripts for analyzing the learned vector fields, primarily used for the ablation studies mentioned in the paper.
*   **`knn/knn_build_index.py`**: Builds a k-Nearest Neighbors index on the dataset actions.
*   **`knn/validate_velocity_field.py`**: Validates the velocity field generated by the flow matching policy relative to the training data.
